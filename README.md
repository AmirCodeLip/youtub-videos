# YouTube Tutorials · Code Repository  
This repository hosts the source code, sample projects and accompanying materials for my YouTube programming tutorials.

## 🎯 About  
I’m using this repo to publish all the examples, mini-projects and code walkthroughs that I cover in my YouTube channel. It’s meant to help both you (the viewer) **and** me (the creator) stay organised, follow along, and have a central reference for the code.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure  
Here’s a rough breakdown of how the repo is organised:  



/FightClubApi ← Example project in Go + REST API
/FightClubConsole ← Console-based Go project
/GoConsoleBeginner ← Beginner Go console tutorial
/GoGameSocket ← Socket-programming game tutorial in Go
/HttpErrorHandler ← HTTP error-handling patterns
/design patterns ← Code samples of software design patterns
/todo_list ← Todo-list app (various languages)
/todolist ← Alternate version or tutorial branch

> **Languages & tech used:** At present the repository includes Go and Python (and some HTML).  
> This mirrors my interest in both system architecture and backend development.

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmirCodeLip/youtub-videos.git


Navigate to the folder of the tutorial you’re interested in.

Follow the README (if present) in that folder to run or build the example.

If you’re watching the video, make sure you check the commit corresponding to the video’s date/time (if noted) so your code matches the video.

🎥 Video Tutorial Link

For each folder/project I typically publish a YouTube video explaining the concept and walking through the code.
(Insert the YouTube link(s) here when you publish them)

✅ Why this matters

You get hands-on code that maps directly to the tutorial.
I keep the code open-source so you can fork, modify, learn and build on top.
Having a repo means you can come back later and reuse or enhance any sample.

💡 Planning ahead

I’m planning to add tutorials & code on topics like:
Advanced Go patterns (channels, concurrency)
System architecture & design patterns in Python,Go
Integrating with DevOps practices & CI/CD

And of course, fun side-projects (IoT, sound processing) that tie into my broader learning journey.
